# Eurorack-Modules

This is the central repo for all the "This is not Rocket Science" eurorack modular synth modules.

Please refer to the "Production" folder if you are looking for boards to build. You will find all the design & firmware files for our latest production versions. Artwork is NOT included. Be creative. 

All our current development & experiments can be found in the "Development" folder

Sourcecode to the firmware can be found in the Eurorack-KDS repository

Tools needed:

- Eagle 7+
- Kinetis Development Studio (or whatever the latest NXP/freescale IDE is)
- A JTAG probe to flash the initial firmware
